Hello! 

My name is Kesh and I have been a personal trainer for 12 years.

My goal with any person who walks through the door is to give them a thorough and wide ranging ability to resist injury, develop the ranges of motion that will allow them to tackle the tasks relevant to them and finally test this range of motion with exercises of increasing neuromuscular complexity to create smart, versatile athletes regardless of final activity.

I have taken nationally accredited courses in Kettlebell training, studied extensively with movement coaches and am a certified Functional Range Conditioning mobility specialist (FRCms®) by Dr. Andreo Spina, a world-renowned musculoskeletal and human movement expert who is the creator of Functional Range Conditioning (FRC®).

FRC® is a system of joint health and mobility training based on new scientific research that has been adopted by many elite level Soccer, Baseball, Ice Hockey, Basketball, Powerlifting, and Mixed Martial Artists.

What I have blended together and teach (as well as practice) is a composite athletic program based around mobility development, movement work borne of martial arts, gymnastics, kettlebells, bodyweight and traditional resistance tools.
